Welcome to the Playtech internship test challenge! Please examine the following examples before beginning the challenge.

Given a matrix of 4x4. Each cell contains a unique number [0-15], e.g.

Fig 1.

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9 10 11 12
13 14 15  0

You are allowed to swap 0 with any of its (up to 4) adjacent numbers. From a given matrix, the goal is to reach the setup of Fig 1., e.g.
Fig 2.

1  2  3  4
5  6  7  8
9 10  0 12
13 14 11 15

I.e.:
step 1) swap 11 and 0.
step 2) swap 15 and 0

Challenge:

Write a Java program (command line) that accepts one parameter pointing to a directory with files having extension: "p15". Read files only with that extension, ignore others, if present. The files contain the setup explained above - numbers [0-15] separated by one or more spaces and a new line denoting the end of a matrix row, 4 rows in total.
For each file with such extension, print to the standard output the name of a file and then the number of moves taken to reach the setup of Fig 1. (e.g. "case44.p15 - 12"). In case the file contains an invalid input or a setup that cannot reach Fig 1., print an error number to the standard error output, e.g. "case11.p15 - -1". Error numbers:
-1 : The file contains a setup that cannot reach fig 1
-2 : The file contains an invalid input (for example letters or numbers over 15, duplicate numbers, etc.)
-3 : Unexpected error

The provided program should not be using any 3rd party libraries, and must rely only on the classes available in JDK.
Example files are included as attachments.


Tips:
* This 'game' has been known since mid/late 19th century as "Puzzle 15".
* If the task is too challenging - try a 3x3 matrix with [0-8], first. 
* You do not need to find the solution with the fewest number of moves to reach Fig 1. There is no scoring based on the result.
* If you have questions, do write back.


Have fun!
